# Protein Sequences Analysis and Classification
### Sixuan Feng / Weixin Li
## Purpose 
'I have a protein of interest but don't know its structure/function' is one of the most common problems that many molecular and cell biologists face in their research. Therefore, our team decided to explore the hidden information inside the protein sequences by analyzing more than 400,000 amino acids sequences and give insights to protein type(classification) and some characteristics about this protein(prediction) like PH Scale, Crystallization Temperature, etc. For this project we would focus on one-dimensional structure of protein (amino acids chain) to learn and infer more about given protein. 

## Dataset 
We are going to use a protein data set retrieved from Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) Protein Data Bank (PDB). It contains protein metadata which includes details on protein classification, extraction methods, experimental technique, etc. There are two data files which are both arranged by structure Id. 

## Experimental Steps
0.	Data Cleaning
We plan to do data cleaning first to analyze problems more specifically
1.	Deal with the data:
For the processed dataset, use a split 80% training set, 10% validation set and 10% test data.
2.	Build suitable machine learning models:
Adopt different machine learning methods for classification (protein type) and prediction (specific features).
3.	Comparison and Summary:
Compare and evaluate in the aspect of algorithm accuracy and efficiency.
Analyze the comparison result and give a summary review as well as future suggestion.
